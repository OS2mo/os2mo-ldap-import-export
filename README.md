### Running the tests

You use `poetry` and `pytest` to run the tests:

`poetry run pytest -s`

You can also run specific files

`poetry run pytest tests/<test_folder>/<test_file.py>`

and even use filtering with `-k`

`poetry run pytest -k "Manager"`

You can use the flags `-vx` where `v` prints the test & `x` makes the test stop if any tests fails (Verbose, X-fail)
